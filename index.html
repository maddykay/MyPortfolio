      <h1>Hi! üëãüèº</h1>
      <h2>My name is Maddy Thomas</h2><br>
      <div>
        <p>I am a UX professional living in Orange County, Calif. I came into the
          UX world because I enjoy thinking human-centric and I love being creative. Before becoming a UX professional,
          I
          felt as though my passion (and degree) for psychology was being wasting as I worked
          for a credit union processing home loans. But when I found the UX profession, I knew I had found my true
          calling
          because I was able to utilize my eye for design, my creative intelligence and true love of
          human nature.<br></p>
